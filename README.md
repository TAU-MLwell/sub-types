# sub-types

Some diseases may have sub-types that react differently to treatment. Therefore, finding a cure for such diseases requires identifying these subtypes. 
In this work we are taking a method that has been presented theoretically in previous work and implement it for the purpose of finding sub-types of diseases, using machine learning tools. The aim of the current study is to take advantage of the differences between separate populations, using an additional observed signal which is corelated with the unobserved target variable (sub-type), to better recover the underlying structure of a disease.
